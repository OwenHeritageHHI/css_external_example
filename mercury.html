    <h1>The Planet Mercury</h1>
        <h2>Introduction to Mercury</h2>
        <p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting closest to the Sun. It is a rocky, terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface, similar in appearance to Earth’s Moon. Mercury has virtually no atmosphere, which means it cannot retain heat, leading to extreme temperature fluctuations. During the day, temperatures can soar up to 800°F (427°C), while at night, they can drop to as low as -290°F (-180°C). These drastic changes make Mercury one of the most inhospitable planets for life as we know it.</p>
        
        <h2>Mercury’s Distance from the Sun</h2>
        <p>Mercury is located approximately 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) from the Sun, making it the closest planet to our star. Despite its proximity to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet—Venus holds that title due to its thick atmosphere that traps heat. Because Mercury has such a small mass, it has very little gravitational pull compared to Earth. This weak gravity contributes to its inability to maintain a stable atmosphere, which is why it has such extreme temperature variations.</p>
        
        <h2>Rotation and Revolution of Mercury</h2>
        <p>One of Mercury’s most fascinating characteristics is its unique rotation and revolution. It takes Mercury about 88 Earth days to complete one full orbit around the Sun, making it the fastest-orbiting planet in the solar system. However, its rotation is much slower; a single day on Mercury (one full rotation on its axis) lasts about 59 Earth days. This slow rotation combined with its fast orbit leads to unusual day-night cycles. If you were standing on Mercury’s surface, you would see the Sun rise, briefly set, and then rise again in some regions before continuing its path across the sky.</p>
        
        <h2>The Importance of Studying Mercury</h2>
        <p>Studying Mercury is challenging due to its close proximity to the Sun, but space missions like NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft have provided valuable data about its surface, magnetic field, and composition. Learning about Mercury helps scientists understand more about the formation of rocky planets, including Earth. Given its unique properties and extreme environment, Mercury continues to be an important subject of scientific exploration. If your classroom had access to a high-resolution 3D printer, it would be possible to create detailed models of Mercury’s surface features, helping students visualize and better understand the planet’s geology.</p>
