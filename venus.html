        <h1>Venus: Earth's Mysterious Twin</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Venus, often called Earth's "sister planet," is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest in the solar system. Despite its similarities in size and composition to Earth, Venus has an extreme climate and hostile atmosphere that make it a fascinating yet inhospitable world.
        </p>
        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Venus is nearly the same size as Earth, with a diameter of about 12,104 km. It has a dense atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating an extreme greenhouse effect that traps heat and raises surface temperatures to an average of 467°C (872°F). This makes Venus hotter than Mercury, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.
        </p>
        <h2>Geological Features</h2>
        <p>
            The surface of Venus is marked by volcanic plains, vast plateaus, and highland regions. It has more volcanoes than any other planet in the solar system, with over 1,600 major volcanoes identified. Some of these may still be active today. The planet lacks plate tectonics like Earth, which influences its geological activity differently.
        </p>
        <h2>Atmosphere and Climate</h2>
        <p>
            The atmosphere of Venus is composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid that obscure the planet’s surface from view. This dense atmosphere creates a runaway greenhouse effect, trapping heat and making Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System, with surface temperatures exceeding 460°C (860°F). The atmospheric pressure is about 92 times that of Earth, equivalent to being nearly a kilometer underwater.
        </p>
        <p id="quote">
            "Venus is the most Earth-like planet in many ways, yet it is radically different in others. Understanding these differences is key to planetary science." — Dr. Stephen Kane, astrophysicist
        </p>
        <h2>Exploration and Scientific Interest</h2>
        <p>
            Several space missions have explored Venus, including NASA's Mariner and Magellan probes and the Soviet Union's Venera program, which successfully landed on the planet's surface. Future missions, such as NASA's VERITAS and ESA's EnVision, aim to uncover more details about Venus' geological history and atmosphere.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Venus remains one of the most intriguing planets in our solar system. Studying it helps scientists understand planetary climates, geological activity, and the potential for extreme conditions elsewhere in the universe. Despite its harsh environment, Venus continues to captivate astronomers and researchers worldwide.
