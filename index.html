                The solar system is a fascinating and complex collection of celestial bodies that revolve around the Sun. It consists of planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other cosmic objects. Understanding the solar system helps us comprehend Earth's place in the universe and the mechanics of planetary motion.

            <h2>The Sun: The Center of the Solar System</h2>
            <p>
                At the heart of the solar system is the Sun, a massive ball of hot plasma that provides light and heat to all planets. The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and generates energy through nuclear fusion. This energy is essential for life on Earth and influences the movement of all celestial bodies in the system.

            <h2>The Planets of the Solar System</h2>
            <p>The solar system contains eight recognized planets, which are divided into two groups:</p>

            <h3>The Inner Planets</h3>
            <p>
                Also known as terrestrial planets, the inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. They are relatively small, have solid surfaces, and are composed mostly of rock and metal.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun, with extreme temperature fluctuations.</li>
                <li>Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet.</li>
                <li>Earth is the only known planet to support life, with liquid water covering most of its surface.</li>
                <li>
                    Mars, often called the "Red Planet," has the largest volcano in the solar system and may have once had liquid water.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The Outer Planets</h3>
            <p>
                The outer planets, also known as gas giants and ice giants, include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are much larger than the inner planets and mostly composed of gas and ice.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jupiter is the largest planet and has a Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has lasted for centuries.</li>
                <li>Saturn is known for its spectacular ring system made of ice and rock.</li>
                <li>Uranus is tilted on its side, possibly due to a past collision with another celestial body.</li>
                <li>Neptune is the farthest planet and has the strongest winds in the solar system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Dwarf Planets and Other Celestial Bodies</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to the eight main planets, the solar system includes several dwarf planets, such as Pluto, Ceres, and Eris. These bodies are smaller and do not meet all the criteria to be classified as full-fledged planets.
            </p>

            <p>
                Asteroids, primarily found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, are rocky remnants from the early solar system. Comets, made of ice and dust, originate from the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, sometimes developing bright tails when they approach the Sun.
            </p>

            <h2>The Role of Gravity in the Solar System</h2>
            <p>
                Gravity plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure of the solar system. The Sun's gravity keeps planets in orbit, while planetary gravity influences the movement of moons, asteroids, and comets. Without gravity, the celestial bodies would drift away into space.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The solar system is a dynamic and intricate system that continues to fascinate scientists and astronomers. From the blazing Sun to the icy depths of Neptune, every celestial body has unique characteristics. Studying the solar system helps us understand the universe and our place within it.
